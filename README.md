# Classification-Segmentation-of-Skin-Cancer
Classification &amp; Segmentation of Skin Cancer

# Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a tool that can help doctors find the cancer cells
and ultimately save human lives. In order to create a system that can calculate the
probability that a skin mole can be malign, we’ll have to explore Transfer Learning and
Convolutional Neural Networks. To train this model we are planning to use processed
skin cancer images from ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archive taken
through dermatoscope. Dermoscopy images are acquired via a specialized instrument
(Dermatoscope) and histological images are acquired via invasive biopsy and
microscopy; whereby both modalities yield highly standardized images.

# About Dataset
A large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin
lesions is taken from open-access dermatology repositories, the ISIC Dermoscopic
Archive, ‘The HAM 10000’. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images
which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes.
